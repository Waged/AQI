    <string name="about_us_txt2">We must be just as much aware of the quality of our air as we are
        of the food we eat and the water we drink.We believe that people do not understand the
        entirety of the negative effects of air pollution. We believe as a company in AQI India that
        educating people about air pollution will improve their lives &amp; the lives of their loved
        ones. We, at AQI India work for you to be aware of the air you are breathing in. By making
        Air Pollution monitors, we help you to know how much pollutants are around you and how you
        can be away from it or keep yourself safe from it. We, at AQI India want you to know WHAT
        YOU BREATHE. </string>
